A Parts file for Fritzing: A generic module for sensors with LM393
I am playing with Arduino these days.
I've found that LM393 is quite common when it comes to resistance sensors. These sensors all need 3.3~5.0Volt and a 10kΩ resistance to function properly.
You can see the same part in many different sensor modules which can be bought online.

For example:

Thus, I think it's important to build a seperate module so that all kinds of sensors can be easily linked to the system without a separate 10kΩ resistance.
Basically, this part is like this:

You can also purchase this online, but it could be much more expensive than holistic sensor modules. I'd rather purchase those sensor modules and then replace those sensors with sensors that I really need.
